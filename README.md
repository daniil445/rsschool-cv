# My TypeScript Journey

## Course 'Beginner's TypeScript'

Here is my result of the course:
![This is an alt text.](https://res.cloudinary.com/total-typescript/image/upload/v1741557716/certificate/f802ebda-3160-4a79-b5f4-4cb7a1eaf209/beginners-typescript.png "This is my score")

Feedback: *I liked the course, but it consisted of exception tasks. As for me, the title does not match the course, "You won't believe how to implement this!" would be more appropriate.*

## Course 'Learn TypeScript step by step in an interactive environment'

Here is my result of the course: __I finished it__, 7 free chapters. Nothing to add.

Feedback: _I liked this course more, it is clear that they did it in detail so that the student would not have any questions, since everything is clear._
 

## Reflections
_To be honest, I'm afraid of dynamic typing and it seems to me that TypeScript is a real **salvation!**_
