I'm looking for a professional team, who keep up with the times, and not afraid difficult tasks. My goal is to grow in a team of people who are just as motivated as I am. I absorb information on the fly and have never violated deadlines due to my own fault, either during training or at work. I have communication skills and perceive expert opinion as the main thing. I understand perfectly well that my status is now low, but it is growing steadily, and I am confident that the work team will instill in me the necessary expert habits of behavior.

My skills have different vectors of development:
	Markdown,  C++ , Java , Python ,
	HTML, CSS, 
	Qt , 
	OOP , Color models(HEX/RGB/HSL) ,  
	Git,
	ADT, NGINX, MODBUS , GitHub, CMake, qmake.

You can see my coding style here:
(Modificated C++(Qt), Calculating points of Equilateral polygon by mouse cursor)
if(abstruct_name.contains("Equilateral polygon")){
	multi_prim.clear();
	for(int var = 0; var < multi_num; ++var) {
		double radius=sqrt(pow(start_painting.y()- stop_painting.y(),2)+pow(start_painting.x()- stop_painting.x(),2));
		double fi =atan2(start_painting.y()- stop_painting.y(),start_painting.x()-stop_painting.x());
		QPointF point;
		point.setX(start_painting.x()+radius*cos(M_PI+fi+2*M_PI*var/multi_num));
		point.setY(start_painting.y()+radius*sin(M_PI+fi+2*M_PI*var/multi_num));
		multi_prim.append(point);
	}
	polyline_prim<<multi_prim;
	polyline_prim<<multi_prim.first();
}

Here you can clearly see how I have gained experience over the last 13 years:

Technician
FGUP "GosNIIPP", St. Petersburg
August 2011 – September 2013 (2 years, 2 months)
My responsibilities included creating unit tests and gradually introducing
myself into Android development.
 Maintained computer stations and administered networks,
ensuring seamless IT operations.
Сase: With help in developing a cartographic application, I identified bugs
in several open custom views on GitHub

Then there were 3 years of development in java for android...

Lead Software Engineer
AO "VNIIZhT", St. Petersburg
December 2016 – February 2020 (3 years, 3 months)
The main task is to automate the system, recording the parameters of the
performance of the main processes of railway trains for repair purposes in
real time.
 Created and configured Arduino-based simulations, wrote SQL
queries for product testing, and developed web applications.
 Designed and managed Wi-Fi hotspots, Linux-based servers, and
video content streaming.

Then there were 4 years of development in C++ for Windows...

Student RS School
November 2024 - now
Learning Marcdown, HTML and Git.
 Created and configured form for pickle delivery.

I use duolingo to maintain my English. Last quarter I visited London and Tisbury where I practiced my communication skills with a nice elderly couple for 2 weeks.
